Aerospace heat shield material focus right now is on the following:
Ti matrix and SiC fibre MMC (Ti/SiC) 
. reinforced with continuous SiC fibres w/ titanium matrix. [nickname Ti/SiC]
SiCp 
. reinforeced with silicon carbide particles w/ aluminium matrix. [nickname SiCp/Al]
Ni/SiC 
. reinforced with silicon carbide particles w/ nickel alloy matrix. [nickname Ni/SiC] 

Still need to search for the following information for each material:
- Tm SiCp has 660C melting point (Fan et al., 2005) but SiCp does not melt, Ti/SiC 1668C (Rahman et al., 2017), 
- thermal conductivity Ti-SiC has a 3.6 (Turner et al., 1993), SiC/Al has a 174 (Chu et al., 2009),
- expansion coefficient
- damage tolerance.toughness
- prior aerospace applications
Understanding these properties will inform the sim parameters and improve prediction of the failure mechanisms under thermal/mechanical stresses typical of spacecraft heat shield environments upon re-entry.

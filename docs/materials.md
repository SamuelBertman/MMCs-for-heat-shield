Aerospace heat shield material focus right now is on the following:
Ti matrix and SiC fibre MMC (Ti/SiC) 
. reinforced with continuous SiC fibres w/ titanium matrix. [nickname Ti/SiC]
SiCp 
. reinforeced with silicon carbide particles w/ aluminium matrix. [nickname SiCp]
Self-healing Al-Si/NiTi MMC 
. reinforced with NiTi shape memory alloy wires w/ aluminium-silicon eutectic alloy matrix. [nickname Al-Si/NiTi] 

[Al-Si/NiTi] - has 91.6% tensile strenght recovery after healing (Fisher et al., 2018)

Still need to search for the following information for each material:
- Tm
- thermal conductivity
- expansion coefficient
- damage tolerance.toughness
- prior aerospace applications
Understanding these properties will inform the sim parameters and improve prediction of the failure mechanisms under thermal/mechanical stresses typical of spacecraft heat shield environments upon re-entry.

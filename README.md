# Failure-Domain Benchmarking of Aerospace MMCs Under Hypothetical Re-entry Conditions

## Overview
This project investigates the performance limits of three metal matrix composites (MMCs):
- Ti/SiC (continuous SiC fibres in titanium matrix)
- SiCp/Al (SiC particle-reinforced aluminium matrix)
- Ni/SiC (SiC particle-reinforced nickel alloy matrix)

These materials are **not heat shield candidates**. Their melting points and property degradation under re-entry profiles mean they fail well before true thermal protection materials (e.g., UHTCs, reinforced carbon-carbon).  

The objective here is **not survivability**, but **failure-domain mapping**:
- Quantify thermal stress, creep, modulus degradation, and thermal gradients under extreme aerospace heating.
- Benchmark how and why these MMCs collapse when pushed beyond intended regimes.
- Build a transferable simulation framework that can later be applied to ultra-high-temperature ceramics.

## Goals
- Develop critical literature synthesis of MMC aerospace applications.
- Implement Python-based thermal gradient + stress simulations.
- Produce a research poster/infographic targeted for RSC Materials track.
- Publish a technical blog post documenting methodology and insights.
- Package clean, documented simulation notebooks in this repo.
- Submit to RSC Student Poster Competition (Materials).
- Update vision document with reflection on failure-domain methodology.

## Deliverables
- Critical literature summary (annotated + evaluative).
- Jupyter Notebook: Thermal gradient + thermal stress simulations.
- Poster (RSC submission ready).
- Blog post update.
- GitHub repo with:
  - Clean simulations
  - Documentation
  - Research narrative
- Vision doc update with reflection.

## Strategic Impact
- Demonstrates capability to **push materials to breaking point** and extract insight.
- Positions work as **comparative failure-domain analysis**, a mindset essential in aerospace R&D.
- Builds a **modular sim framework** for UHTCs and future materials research.
- Establishes early competitive visibility in aerospace materials chemistry.

# MMC Heat Shield Research Project

## Overview
This project explores the use of Metal Matrix Composites (MMC) for aerospace heat shields. MMCs provide a strong, heat-resistant, and lightweight structural layer crucial for protecting spacecraft during re-entry.

## Objectives
- Understand the role and behavior of MMCs in heat shield design.
- Investigate heat transfer and mechanical properties of MMC under high temperatures.
- Create sketches, diagrams, and simulations related to MMC heat shield layers.
- Document weekly reflections to track learning progress and insights.
